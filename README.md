Implementing Motion capture technology in animating Dance Sequence
The Mocap technique had been commonly used in several areas especially in producing realistic animation movies and games. Mo-cap techniques has a powerful strength over other animation techniques which is real-time visualization, so after applying some processing on the captured scene we can see exactly how the animation will look like and will be able to apply changes to the movement and capture again and so on. In addition, this technique provides a high quality natural looking animation. In this project we are using the optical Mocap system to generate an animation movie.
