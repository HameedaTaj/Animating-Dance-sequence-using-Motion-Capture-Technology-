Implementing Motion capture technology in animating Dance Sequence
The Mocap technique had been commonly used in several areas especially in producing realistic animation movies and games. Mo-cap techniques has a powerful strength over other animation techniques which is real-time visualization, so after applying some processing on the captured scene we can see exactly how the animation will look like and will be able to apply changes to the movement and capture again and so on. In addition, this technique provides a high quality natural looking animation. In this project we are using the optical Mocap system to generate an animation dance sequence.

The steps involved in this process are shown below as the "Motion Capture Pipeline". 

1.Decide on concept to capture 

2.Setup the motion capture environment 

3.Motion capture steps 

4.Dress up the performer 

5.Capture the motion 

6.Post- process 

7.Export/Import to Maya 

8.Bind the model to skeleton 

9.Export/Import to Unity 

10.Add background 

11.Check the motions 

12.Play the animated movie
